# bootstrap-project-1

For this project, team 2 agreed that every member attempts the full project, to ensure we are all comfortable to complete a project without depending on the help or efficiency of one team member.
Each contributor worked on the whole project.
We achieved responsiveness by making use of the default bootstrap breakpoints.
