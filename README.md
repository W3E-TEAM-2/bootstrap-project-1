@Wakilat#5463
Bootstrap and a bit of Pure CSS was used in recreating the project
The CDN link for Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap icons were
copied and placed in the appropriate position in the HTML file
created for the project.
The div tag with a container class as bootstrap  was created to wrap the whole project code
The desired navbar codes were copied after searching in the bootstrap website and placed
in the header tag with a container-fluid class to set the container to 100% width of the parent
Container, the navbar items are hidden with bootstrap codes on mobile screen while it expands 
on medium to large screens.
The other contents of the container was placed accordingly after searching in bootstrap website 
to get the right code for the content and they are all contained in a container set to fluid
with the right margin and padding to style the contents
